## <a name="">What is Apptainer?</a>

Apptainer, formerly known as Singularity, is a containerization solution developed by Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory and Sylabs. It is speciafically designed for scientific and high-performance computing environments that allows users to run their own unique environments in different resources (such as Spiedie). 

The entire execution environment is contained within a single file, called as an image. It can contained a base Llinux File system, libraries, data, and scripts required to run a specific program. 


## <a name="">Why use Apptainer?</a>

With Apptainer, a user can design and test their program in their local environemnt with higher privilages (i.e. sudo), create a container, transport the container onto Spiedie and run their experiment at a much larger scale. 

Users can generate their own container images, use a docker image, or download an image off of the Apptainer hub.
