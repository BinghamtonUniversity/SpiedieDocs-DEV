## <a name="SCP"></a> SCP

#### Single File Transfer to/from Spiedie Cluster

SCP (secure copy) is a command-line utility that allows you to securely copy files and directories between two locations.  

``` bash
scp source.ext <username>@spiedie.binghamton.edu:path/to/destination
``` 
Lets look at the components of the scp command:

* `source.ext` is the file you wish to transfer to the remote server.
* `<username>` is the username of your spiedie cluster account.
* `path/to/destination` is the path to the directory you want to transfer to.


To transfer a file **from** spiedie onto your local computer, simply swap the source and destination.

``` bash
scp <username>@spiedie.binghamton.edu:your/desired/directory/file.txt .
```
The `.` at the end is a shortcut for you current working directory.

#### Transferring a Directory to Spiedie Cluster

This is similar to transferring a single file except instead of specifying a file, we specify a directory, `local-directory`, and we add the `-r` flag which tells scp that we are trying to transfer a directory.

``` bash 
scp -r local-directory <username>@spiedie.binghamton.edu:your/desired/destination
```

## <a name="RSYNC"> </a> 2.2.2 Rsync
***
Similar to SCP, Rsync can also be used to transfer files and folders using the terminal. Rsync differs in that only the portions of the files that have been changed are transferred, minimizing the total amount of data transferred.

Use Rsync when:
  * You are transferring large files.
    * In case of network connection failure mid transfer.
    * The entire file does not need to be transferred, only the parts that changed.
  * When keeping remote and local directories synced.
    * Using the rsync command to sync the directories will only transfer the changed files.

``` bash 
rsync file.ext <username>@spiedie.binghamton.edu:your/desired/directory 
```
