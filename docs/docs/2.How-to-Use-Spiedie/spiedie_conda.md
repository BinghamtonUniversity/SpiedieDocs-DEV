## <a name="conda_intro"></a> What is Conda?

Conda is an open-source package management and environment system. It allows you create isolated virtual environments and install software packages without requiring root access. If a program or package is not available as a [module](spiedie_modules.html), we highly recommend you use Conda to install it and all it's required dependencies. 

## <a name="conda_activate"></a> Activating Conda on Spiedie

---

In order to activate Conda at log in on Spiedie, log in and run the following command: 

``` bash
/opt/ohpc/pub/apps/miniforge3/bin/conda init
```

Then, close the session and log back in.

You should see the terminal include the base environment tag like: 

```bash
(base)[username@spiedie81 ~]:
```

If you would like to disable Conda at log in and would like to use Conda, run: 

```bash 
conda activate 
```

If you would not like to activate automatically at log in run the following command: 

``` bash
