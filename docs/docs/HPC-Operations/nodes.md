## At a Glance

The Binghamton University High-Performance Computing Cluster, aptly name “Spiedie” in honor of the city of Binghamton's culinary invention, is a 3688 compute core & 512 Knights Landing core cluster housed in the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science's data center located at the Innovative Technology Complex. This research facility offers computer capabilities for researchers across Binghamton University. To gain access yourself, please refer to the ["Obtaining Access to Spiedie" Doc](../How-to-Use-Spiedie/gain_access.md). For acces to nodes and partitions specific to individual research groups, please contact your Principal Investigator. Extended node information and features can be seen by running the "sinfo" command on Spiedie with output options specified.
